#### Recursion - is when a function calls itself
##### Or is problem solving technique where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem

#### Why - is a greate technique to simplfy your solution
##### if you find yourself breaking down your problem into smaller versions of the same problem recursion is very useful

#### Points
#### 1. Every recursive solution needs to have a base case/ a condition to terminate the recursion
#### 2. Recursion might simplfy solution the problem, but it doeesn't always translate to a faster solution. A recursive solution may be far worse than an iterative solution
